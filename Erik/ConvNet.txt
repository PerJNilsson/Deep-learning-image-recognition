*** ConvNet_1_x ***
The aim of ConvNet_1_x is to only use commands, whose purpose I understand at the present.
The network contains 6 convolutional layers with 3 max pooling + dropout layers in between.
Followed by a Flatten layer, dense layer, dropout layer and lastly a dense layer(NUM_CLASSES, activation='softmax')
All layers, except the last one are Relu

In ConvNet_1_x a few hyperparameters will be varied in order to identify optimal choices with regard to accuracy.
If possible varying degrees of preprocessing will also be applied with the same end goal.

*ConvNet_1_1*
Dropout(between conv layers) = 0.2
MaxPooling(between conv layers) = pool_size=(2, 2)
Dropout(before output layer) = 0.5

Preprocessing:
Only crop = equal to shortest side
Resize = 48x48
